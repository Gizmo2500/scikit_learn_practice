## This repo is being used to practice using Python packages for data analysis, data science, and machine learning. 
Please use mini-conda or anaconda to install the required packages needed and add them to a "./env" folder.

Here are the packages I am currently using:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebooks
